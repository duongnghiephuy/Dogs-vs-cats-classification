Simple Student Project in free time

I don't want to waste my free time after school so I dedicate a bit of time doing some simple projects.

Project 1: Dogs vs Cats: Training model using convolutional layers
                         |Training model using pretrained Conv
                         |Feature extraction to visualzie Convolutional Layer
